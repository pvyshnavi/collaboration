#collaboration Portal



This project is based on a collaboration website which involves chatrooms, obtaining specific information, blogs and all there is to reach a common goal of what the client or the user needs.

The programming tool used is the Eclipse IDE and the programming language used is java, alongside Oracle Database, Spring and Hibernate frameworks at it's backend. For testing the inputs and outputs in the JSON format at the backend, a tool named 'postman' is explicitly used here. The frontend makes use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AngularJS. The project is thus combined in a build tool called Maven, alongside JUnit, all together in a nutshell.
